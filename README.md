# NotKickstarter

This is a project that aims to change the philanthropy/crowdfunding business.

All too often, donors and crowdfunders are left in the dark as far as how their money is spent by the cause that they are spending their money on.

Who know how they spend the money? NotKickstarter is here to solve this problem of ambiguity.
